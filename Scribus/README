This is Scribus Version 1.3.5.

CHANGES 1.3.3.x to 1.3.5
========================

1) Because of the new file format features, Scribus documents saved in 1.3.5
   are *not* backward compatible with 1.3.3.x or 1.2.x .

2) You *can* install both versions in parallel and run them at the same time.
   The only caveat is to install them using different prefix/ directories e.g
   1.3.3.x in /usr/local and 1.3.5 in /opt or $home/bin. You can use the
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/dir
   argument to CMake to set where Scribus should be installed.

3) In some cases Scribus 1.3.3 uses wrong character sizes when layouting text. 
   This might cause differences in linebreaking if you open a 1.3.3.x
   document in 1.3.5.

CHANGES 1.2.x to 1.3.x
======================

Important notes on the differences between 1.2.x and 1.3.x:

1) Because of the new file format features, Scribus documents saved in 1.3.x
   are *not* backwardly compatible.

2) Because of the new enhanced menu/keyboard shortcuts code, 1.2.x  keyboard
   short cuts are not migrated and will need to be recreated once on the first
   launch 1.3.x.

3) On initial launch, 1.3.x will offer to convert preferences to the new 1.3.x
   format. This is recommended. Scribus 1.3.x will store its preferences
   separately from 1.2.x. Moreover, 1.3.2 caches available fonts. The first 
   startup may take longer than anticipated. 


4) You *can* install both versions in parallel and run them at the same time.
   The only caveat is to install them using different prefix/ directories e.g
   1.2 in /usr/local and 1.3 in /opt or $home/bin. You can use the --prefix
   argument to configure to set where Scribus should be installed.

CONVERTING 1.1.x DOCUMENTS
==========================

Newer versions of Scribus use a different way to find fonts from Scribus 1.1.1.
To convert older( =< 1.1.1) documents follow the procedure below:

1) Create a document with the old Version of Scribus containing all your Fonts.
2) Open the new Scribus and go to the Font Substitution List.
3) Clear out all current substitutions.
4) Open the Document created in 1) and substitute all the fonts with the
   correct new fonts.

When you now open old documents Scribus will convert all font names
automatically.

For detailed changes please see the ChangeLog.

LANGUAGE SUPPORT
================

To use Scribus in your native language be sure that the environment variable
LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, LANG, Qt locale, OR the command line option of -l/--lang
<lang> is set correctly. This is also can be changed in the preferences and
takes effect immediately.

REQUIRED TOOLS, LIBRARIES AND OTHER FILES
=========================================

GhostScript
-----------

One of the more crucial tools Scribus depends on is Ghostscript. While it is
not required for compilation, Scribus must be able to find a recent version of
Ghostscript at runtime for all features to be present and fully working. In
particular, printing, print preview, and PDF/EPS import will not be fully
functional without Ghostscript. Ghostscript 8.x is STRONGLY recommended.
Support for versions older than 8.x is untested and Scribus may not operate
reliably using such an old version of gs.

You can find out which version of GhostScript Scribus is using in the about
dialog. If you have a newer version installed somewhere else you can
specify its' location in the preferences.

You can get a new version of Ghostscript from http://www.ghostscript.com/ .
There is documentation on how to install a new version of Ghostscript on the
Scribus website:
    http://docs.scribus.net/index.php?lang=en&sm=dtptoolbox&page=toolbox7
or you can just download it and install it in /usr/local, then set your PATH.

Debian users who haven't installed their own newer version of Ghostscript may
want to install gs-gpl then use
    `update-alternatives --config gs'
as root to select gs-gpl as the default version of Ghostscript to use. The ESP
GhostScript used by many Debian systems by default will not work as well as gs-gpl.

ICC Profiles for Colour Management
----------------------------------

Activating Color Management *requires* installation of CMYK and RGB ICC
profiles. Please see the included help files, FAQ's on www.scribus.net and
http://docs.scribus.net for details. As of the 1.3.1 release,  Scribus ships
with 2 icc profiles, which are installed only to enable color management
functionality.  (This is not true for some distribution packages, where
licensing rules prevent the inclusion of a full set of profiles).  The profiles
*do not* provide meaningful color management for printing. Additional profiles
are downloadable from www.scribus.net and depend on your hardware and printing
environment.

KNOWN ISSUES
============

Please see bugs.scribus.net for a more comprehensive list of known issues.

PSD/CMYK TIFF Support
---------------------

1.3.2+ now has support for CMYK PSD and 8-bit CMYK TIFF support. RGB PSD and
16-bit TIFF support is being developed. PSD and TIFF support includes layers, ICC
profiles and embedding clipping paths. CMYKA is supported in Scribus 1.3.4+

FONT ISSUES
-----------

There are extensive notes and detailed on documentation on fonts and trouble
shooting of font issues in the help documentation and online at
http://docs.scribus.net  Please read these carefully before filing bugs.

There are issues with the postscript naming conventions with the Computer Modern
Type 1 fonts, depending on distribution.  In some cases, not all fonts from the
same family are visible in Scribus. We are working on a more complete solution
during a future release.



BUILDING AND INSTALLING FROM SOURCE
===================================

Please see the `BUILDING' file for details on how to compile and install
Scribus, library requirements, etc.




DISTRIBUTION AND OS SPECIFIC NOTES
=====================

Debian
------

If Scribus does not start while complaining about the absence of
Postscript fonts please install either xfonts-scalable or gsfonts-x11.
They are in the "Recommends" and will be installed by all sensible apt
front-ends.

You may not see an entry for colour management in the Scribus preferences. If
you do not, you must install the icc-profiles package from non-free to get a core
set of ICC profiles. This will not provide enough for you to get effective colour
managemnet, but will provide better RGB<->CMYK conversions than the unmanaged mode.
See the "ICC Profiles for colour management" section above for details.

Also see the section entitled `GHOSTSCRIPT' above.

SuSE 
--------

To enable direct CUPS support which recommended, make sure both cups-devel and
openssl-devel are installed. Suse enables ssl support in CUPS. The current
Scribus config checks do not test for this. See the BUILDING file for details.

The Scribus Team builds rpms for all current releases and recommends their use
over self compiling.

Red Hat / Fedora
----------------

The Scribus RPMS in Fedora Extras are of very high quality and have been
created with close cooperation from Fedora maintainers and the Scribus Team. We
recommend them for most users as they will ensure correct integration with the
menuing system and mime types. Alternately, you can use the Fedora Core
repositories maintained on the build server - see the downloads section on
www.scribus.info for details.

There is a separate file, PACKAGING for detailed hints and notes on building
packages for Scribus.

On Fedora, if you report a crash bug, it would be extremely handy if you could
build a debug version of Scribus (-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug argument to cmake)
and get a stack trace. This is not required, but does help us diagnose the
problem more quickly and reliably. Some information on stack traces can be
found here:

http://fedora.linux.duke.edu/wiki/StackTraces

Mac OS X
--------

A Mac OS X native Aqua port is available. More information can be found on
http://aqua.scribus.net/ .

Microsoft Windows
-----------------

There is a separate readme for Windows, please see readme-win32.html in
scribus/doc .

Additional information
======================

More hints and other information are on the www.scribus.net and docs.scribus.net
sites. Full compile, install and FAQ's are available there.

There is a lively on-line community, both on IRC @ #scribus on irc.freenode.net
and the mailing list. Mailing list info can be found at:
 http://nashi.altmuehlnet.de/mailman/listinfo/scribus

Thanks to the many translators, testers, packagers and contributors who make
the Scribus community so special.
