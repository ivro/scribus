This is Scribus Version 1.2.4

The Scribus 1.2.x versions feature a complete rewrite of the rendering engine.
All rendering is done via libart and freetype2. 
This requires that libart_lgpl and freetype2 are installed.

Scribus now includes the Short Words plug-in, which was previously 
installed as a separate plug-in. To prevent upgrade problems, you might want to 
uninstall if it was installed via a package or RPM. This was also shipped as the 
scribus-vlna package in both source and rpm format. See PACKAGING for more details.

Scribus  also has a new OpenOffice.org Writer and Draw importer. This 
requires libxml2, preferably version 2.6.x+. The OpenOffice.org Writer importer
will import styles from the OpenOffice.org doc and will create similar styles
within your Scribus document.

Version 1.2.1 supported Open Office 1.1.x and Star Office 6/7 file formats. 
Version 1.2.2+ supports Open Office 2.x/Star Office 8.x (OASIS) as well.

Scribus 1.2.3+ also includes 2 icc color profiles to make sure color management
is working immediately after install. Note that these are basic generic profiles
are *not* sufficient to ensure good color management. See the help files for details 
under color management. Grey scale icc profiles in images are not supported in this release.

Scribus 1.2.3+ also supports the proposed OpenIcc standard icc profile 
locations: $home/.color/icc and /usr/share/color/icc/ and /usr/local/color/icc/ under
linux or other Unixes.
Scribus will automatically detect them in these locations. Some distro neutral rpms
for installing profiles are available on www.scribus.net.

When you now open old documents Scribus will convert all Font Names
automatically.

For Changes please see the ChangeLog.

To use Scribus in your native language be sure that the environment variable 
LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, LANG, Qt locale, OR the command line option 
of -l/--lang <lang> is set correctly.

The new EPS/PS import feature in 1.2.x uses advanced features of Ghostscript.
We recommend ALL users update to the newest version of Ghostscript available 
for your distro. There are detailed hints on docs.scribus.net for installing
GS 8.x in parallel to the GS installed by your distro.


If you have a 64-bit version of Qt, sometimes ./configure will not detect the 
64-bit version headers. Try : ./configure --enable-libsuffix=64 to test for 64-bit 
versions of libraries. 


Other notes/known issues at the time of release:

Registration color 100%C 100%M 100%Y 100%K does not work properly with UCR enabled.
Registration with UCR disabled works properly. This is fixed in the Scribus 1.3.x releases.

There is a bug in font outline handling for some fonts in the freetype
libraries. It's being worked on upstream. Don't file a bug report. Instead
change the font used if you need the outlines. This is not a Scribus bug. 
Some testing has shown that this bug is not present in freetype 2.1.9, but 
we counsel caution trying to upgrade freetype2. Upgrading freetype2 on some
distros can be quite difficult.

If you offset and image and then re-scale the image within Scribus, the offset
measurements are incorrect. To avoid this, perform scaling operations, then do
and offset moves needed. This is resolved in Scribus 1.3.x releases.

Issue with gradients:

If you have gradient (e.g. with black color) with 50% shade in both beginning 
and end of gradient, you end up with darker center than edges. One expects the
gradient to be with equal shade from beginning to end, especially if there is
no other Color-Stops in-between them.

This we are quite sure is a libart issue and not fixable by us. The gradient will export
and print properly. In the 1.3.x -devel branch using cairo in place of libart 
fixes this issue.

For Debian Users:

If Scribus does not start while complaining about the absence of
PostScript fonts please install either xfonts-scalable or gsfonts-x11.
They are in the "Recommends" and will be installed by all sensible apt
front-ends.

For SuSE 9.x/10.0 Users:

- On Suse 10.0, there is an issue with adding additional font paths in that the 
  font path name is short one character in the font path settings file located in
  %home/.scribus/scribusfont.rc file. The cause at the moment is unknown. See:
  http://bugs.scribus.net/view.php?id=2890 for more details. At the moment, the
  only workaround is to edit this file manually.

- The littlecms libs 1.10, which shipped with 9.0 does not offer complete 
  support for all the the latest CMS features in Scribus 1.2. There are updated
  SuSE 9.x RPM's available on the Scribus.net site. We also recommend using the 
  latest version of lcms. 

- If you are using Qt 3.3.x, please ensure you are using Qt 3.3.2-2+ or greater
  rpms. These versions have an important fix for drag and drop in Scribus. 

- When compiling from source, to enable direct CUPS support which we recommend, make sure
 both cups-devel and  openssl-devel are installed. Suse enables ssl support in CUPS. 

- There is an issue with certain dialogs in Scribus with Suse 9.3 and 10.0
  and Yes, No order. This is adressed in: 
  https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=119090

For Fedora/RH using Qt 3.3.2-6+ has the same fixes.

There is a separate file, PACKAGING for detailed hints and denotes on building
packages for Scribus.

Many other hints and info are on the www.scribus.net and docs.scribus.net
sites. Full compile, install and FAQ's are available there.

There is a lively on-line community, both on IRC @ #scribus on irc.freenode.net
and the mailing list. Mailing list info can be found at:
