This is Scribus Version 1.0RC1, the first Release Candiate for Scribus 1.0.

This Version adds complete Support for Unicode. In order to use it, you
must have Freetype2 installed (of course the Devel Package too).

There is also a new Build-ID String in the About Box. This is mainly for
me to see which libs where used when Scribus was compiled. Please include
this String to any Bugreports you are submitting. His will help a lot.

For Changes please see the ChangeLog.

If Scribus won't start complaining about No Fonts do the following:

1) Make sure that your XF86Config contains a line Load Type1 in the Section Modules
2) Make sure that you have Postscript-Fonts.
3) Make sure that the Path to your Postscript-Fonts contains a Type1 or type1.
4) Make sure that all Fonts listed in fonts.dir and fonts.scale are present.
5) Verify that the Fonts have an encoding that matches your local encoding.

If this is all true, but Scribus won't start do the following:
1) Create a Textfile containing your Fontpaths.
   e.g:
   /usr/share/fonts/Type1,
   /usr/X11/lib/X11/fonts/Type1
2) Save this file as scribusfont.rc in the .scribus Folder in your Home Directory.

To use Scribus in your native language be sure that the
environment variable LANG is set correctly.

Special note for SuSE 8.1 users, you need the devel packages, at least
xdevel.rpm, qtdevel.rpm and tiffdevel.rpm. In the Standard-Install they
were not installed.
