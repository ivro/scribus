This is Scribus Version 1.2
The Scribus 1.2 version features a complete rewrite of the rendering Engine.
All rendering is now done via libart and freetype2. 
This requires that libart_lgpl and freetype2 are installed.

Additionally Scribus uses now a different way to find fonts, sadly this gives
some changes in the font names Scribus uses. To convert old documents follow the
procedure below:

1) Create a document with the old Version of Scribus containing all your Fonts.
2) Open the new Scribus and go to the Font Substitution List.
3) Clear out all current Substitutions.
4) Open the Document created in 1) and substitute all the fonts with the correct new Fonts.

When you open now old Documents Scribus will convert all Font Names
automatically.

For Changes please see the ChangeLog.

To use Scribus in your native language be sure that the environment
variable LANG is set correctly.

The new EPS/PS import feature in 1.2 uses advanced features of Ghostscript. We recommend
ALL users update to the newest version of Ghostscript avialable for your distro.

Special note for SuSE 8.1 users, you need the devel packages, at least
xdevel.rpm, qtdevel.rpm and tiffdevel.rpm. In the Standard-Install they
were not installed.

Other notes/known issues at the time of release:

There is a bug in font outline handling for some fonts in the freetype
libraries. It's being worked on upstream. Don't file a bug report. Instead
change the font used if you need the outlines. This is not a Scribus bug. 
Some testing has shown that this bug is not present in freetype 2.1.9, but 
we counsel caution trying to upgrade freetype2. Upgrading freetype2 on some
distros can be quite difficult.


For Debian Users:

If Scribus does not start while complaining about the absence of
PostScript fonts please install either xfonts-scalable or gsfonts-x11.
They are in the "Recommends" and will be installed by all sensible apt
front-ends.

For SuSE 9.0/9.1 Users.

The littlecms libs 1.10, which shipped with 9.0 does not offer complete support
for all the the latest CMS features in Scribus 1.2. There are updated
SuSE 9.x RPM's available on the scribus.net site. We also recommend using the 
latest version of lcms. 

If you are using Qt 3.3.x, please ensure you are using the latest Qt 3.3.2-2+ rpms.
The -2+ versions have an important fix for drag and drop in Scribus. 

Many other hints and info are on the www.scribus.net site. Full compile, install and FAQ's
are available there.
