This is Scribus Version 1.3.0cvs, the first release of the 1.3.x development
series.

REQUIREMENTS AND BUILDING
=========================

Install the below packages BEFORE running configure or compiling Scribus:

Requirements:
	Qt >= 3.3		(3.3.3 recommended)
	Freetype >= 2.1.0 	(2.1.3+ recommended)
	libart >= 2.3.8+ 	(2.3.16+ recommended)

Recommended:
	CUPS
	libtiff >= 3.6.0
	Fontconfig >= 2.0
	LittleCMS = 1.12 (1.14+ recommended)
	LibXML2 >= 2.6.0
	GhostScript >= 8.0 (8.15 or greater preferred)
	Python >= 2.3
	tkinter for the font sampler script
	python-imaging for the font sampler preview

If any recommended libraries (and their dev/devel packages or headers) are not
installed, some features will be disabled by configure. If you later install
any of these dependencies, you will have to re-run configure and re-compile
Scribus before the features are enabled.

REQUIREMENTS - DETAILS
======================

We strongly recommend having Qt 3.3.3+. Qt 3.3 is now the *minimum*. Older
versions of Qt are *not* supported. If you build Qt from sources, the
recommended ./configure switches are the same as used by KDE. Use of other
switches aside from those used by distro packages can make trouble shooting
issues very difficult at times.
See: http://developer.kde.org/build/compile_kde3_3.html

Scribus requires Freetype. If you are compiling from source, you will need to have the freetype headers installed - these can usually be found in a -devel package for your distro.

It is strongly recommended that you install the CUPS development packages if
you are compiling Scribus. Without CUPS, Scribus will have significantly
reduced printing functionality.

Fontconfig, if installed, will let Scribus find fonts using the same method as
most other major desktop applications such as all KDE and GNOME applications.
If fontconfig support is installed, Scribus will not search your X font path, X
server configuration, or X font server configuration for fonts - it will only
use conts found using fontconfig and any custom font locations configured in
the preferences.

Python will be used to add scripting support to Scribus. If Python is not found, or there are no header files for Python installed (usually because you haven't installed the development package), the scripting support will not be enabled.

See the distro-specific notes below for more information on installing and
using Scribus with your distro.

CHANGES 1.2.x to 1.3.x
======================

Imporant notes on the differences between 1.2.x and 1.3.x:

1) Because of the new file format features, Scribus documents saved in 1.3.x
   are *not* backwardly compatible.

2) Because of the new enhanced menu/keyboard shortcuts code, 1.2.x  keyboard
   short cuts are not migrated and will need to be recreated once on the first
   launch 1.3.0.

3) On initial launch, 1.3.0 will offer to convert preferences to the new 1.3.0
   format. This is recommended. Scribus 1.3.x will store its preferences
   separately from 1.2.x.

4) You *can* install both versions in parallel and run them at the same time.
   The only caveat is to install them using different %prefix/ directories e.g
   1.2 in /usr/local and 1.3 in /opt or $home/bin. You can use the --prefix
   argument to configure to set where Scribus should be installed.

Additionally, Scribus uses a different way to find fonts from Scribus 1.1.1 .
To convert older( =< 1.1.1) documents follow the procedure below:

1) Create a document with the old Version of Scribus containing all your Fonts.
2) Open the new Scribus and go to the Font Substitution List.
3) Clear out all current substitutions.
4) Open the Document created in 1) and substitute all the fonts with the
   correct new fonts.

When you now open old documents Scribus will convert all font names
automatically.

For detailed changes please see the ChangeLog.

To use Scribus in your native language be sure that the environment variable
LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, LANG, Qt locale, OR the command line option
of -l/--lang <lang> is set correctly.

The EPS/PS import feature in 1.3.x uses advanced features of Ghostscript.  We
recommend ALL users update to the newest version of Ghostscript available for
your distro. In addtion, if you still have GS 7.0x, there are detailed hints on
docs.scribus.net for installing GS 8.x in parallel to the GS installed by your
distro.

Activating Color Management *requires* installation of CMYK and RGB ICC
profiles. Please see the included help files, FAQ's on www.scribus.net and
http://docs.scribus.net for details.

Other notes/known issues at the time of release:

There is a bug in font outline handling for some fonts in the freetype
libraries. It's being worked on upstream. Don't file a bug report. Instead
change the font used if you need the outlines. This is not a Scribus bug.
Some testing has shown that this bug is not present in freetype 2.1.9, but
we counsel caution trying to upgrade freetype2. Upgrading freetype2 on some
distros can be quite difficult.

DISTRO SPECIFIC NOTES
=====================

Debian
======

If Scribus does not start while complaining about the absence of
PostScript fonts please install either xfonts-scalable or gsfonts-x11.
They are in the "Recommends" and will be installed by all sensible apt
front-ends.

Recommended packages for compiling from source on Sarge (Debian 3.1):
	libqt3-mt-dev (Required)
	libfreetype6-dev (Required)
	libart-2.0-dev (Required)
	libcupsys2-dev
	liblcms1-dev
	libfontconfig1-dev
	libtiff4-dev
	libxml2-dev
	python2.3-dev  or  python2.4-dev
	gs-afpl

You are unlikely to be able to compile Scribus 1.3.x on Debian 3.0 (Woody) without significant upgrades.

SuSE 9.x
========

1)The littlecms libs 1.10, which shipped with 9.0 does not offer complete 
  support for all the the latest CMS features in Scribus 1.2+. There are updated
  SuSE 9.x RPM's available on the Scribus.net site. We also recommend using the 
  latest version of lcms. 

2)If you are using Qt 3.3.x, please ensure you are using the latest Qt 3.3.2-2+
  rpms. The -2+ versions have an important fix for drag and drop in Scribus. 

3)To enable direct CUPS support which recommended, make sure both cups-devel
  and openssl-devel are installed. Suse enables ssl support in CUPS.

Red Hat / Fedora
================

Fedora/RH users are recommended to have at least Qt 3.3.2-6. These have
important fixes for Scribus. The Scribus RPMS in Fedora Extras are of very high
quality and have been created with close cooperation from Fedora maintainers
and the Scribus Team. We recommend them for most users as they will ensure
correct integration with the menuing system and mime types.

Recommended packages for compiling from source on FC3:
	qt-devel (Required)
	freetype-devel (Required)
	libart_lgpl-devel (Required)
	fontconfig-devel
	cups-devel
	libtiff-devel
	libxml2-devel
	python-devel
	lcms-devel

You can install these packages with 'yum install packagename' as root. You may need to run up2date first to set up your yum configuration. Be patient - the first time you run yum it will take a long time to download the headers for all the security updates that have been released.

There are no packages for LittleCMS or a recent GhostScript in Fedora Core 3, though LittleCMS (lcms) is in Fedora Extras.

Additional information
======================

Many other hints and info are on the www.scribus.net and docs.scribus.net
sites. Full compile, install and FAQ's are available there.

There is a lively on-line community, both on IRC @ #scribus on irc.freenode.net
and the mailing list. Mailing list info can be found at:
 http://nashi.altmuehlnet.de/mailman/listinfo/scribus

Thanks to the many translators, testers, packagers and contributors who make the Scribus
community so special.
