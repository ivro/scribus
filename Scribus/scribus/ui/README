This directory contains Qt Designer .ui files to implement the basic behaviour
of the user interface of some dialogs and windows in the application. It should
not contain any non-generated .cpp or .h files. Subclass the classes defined
by these files to add the behaviour you need.

Please do not use .ui.h files, they're clunky and our build system hates them.
