<h2>PDF Exporting from Scribus</h2>
<h3>Screen Display and On-line PDF Forms</h3>
<p>Choose these settings when downloading speed or small size is important.</p>

<p><b>Recommended Settings and Hints:</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Down-sample all images to 72-96dpi.</li>
	<li>Do not embed fonts. To ensure a reasonably close layout, choose "Base 14 fonts" fonts which are typically included with all versions of Acrobat Reader and have similar substitutions with Ghostscript. This would include your basic variations of Courier, Helvetica, Times New Roman, Symbol and Zapf Dingbat, which are all similar on most PC platforms.</li> 
	<li>Choose the lowest quality setting for compression which has acceptable on-screen viewing results.</li>
	<li>You can often substitute Arial for Helvetica, as later viewers will often have this as an included font.</li> 
	<li>Avoid importing EPS or PDFs into your document - instead convert them to PNG with GSview, then place in your Scribus document. Why? They will render faster on your screen and often make for a smaller file size.</li>
	<li>Avoid using the Nimbus fonts, if they are not at least sub-set. Acrobat Reader on other platforms does a poor job of substitution using its included fonts. One other issue which can trip you up is Helvetica is often alised to Nimbus Sans L on many distros.</li>
	<li>Unless transparency in artwork is needed, select PDF 1.3 output for the greatest compatibility with other users.</li>
