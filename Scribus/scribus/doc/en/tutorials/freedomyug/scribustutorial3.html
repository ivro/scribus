<p><b>[Get Picture]</b> Click to select the top-icon in the Tools palette, and then right-click anywhere inside this picture frame. You will see a menu pop-up right under the mouse cursor. Select 'Get Picture' from this menu. A dialog-box opens up for you to navigate into your FYug folder, and then into the images folder, so you can select the 'TitleFX.jpg' sample image. Click on the OK button. The picture frame on your Scribus page is immediately filled with the TitleFX.jpg image. 
</p>

<p><b>[Nudge Picture to Left]</b> Note the sculpture in the image is too much to the right. We must drag the picture inside the picture frame to the left, so that the sculpture is positioned in the centre of the picture frame. Extra parts of the picture will get automatically cropped out of view beyond the boundaries of the picture frame. So, to move the picture, make sure the picture frame is selected, go back to the Properties dialog box, and click on the top-right tab titled 'Image'. In the field marked X-Pos, just type in the value &#8220;-90mm&#8221; to move the image 90 mm to the left. Note how the image is shifted inside the picture frame.</p>

<p><b>[Color Karma]</b> At the bottom of the Properties dialog box, you may have noticed a section called 'Input Profiles.' This will only show if the LittleCMS on your PC is correctly installed and configured. The color of your images may look markedly different on your screen, and even more when you print them. This little area minimizes such color mismatch. From the pop-up for 'Input Profile', choose a color profile that closely matches your monitor. Scribus immediately re-renders the image on the screen to display colors according to that profile. 
</p>

<p>The actual install of LittleCMS and how to use it under Scribus is actually quite simple, but beyond the scope of this tutorial. But here are some good tips: 
</p>
<p>1) Download a set of free profiles from the adobe site, so you can send images between Mac, Windows, and GnuLinux. 2) Create a custom color profile of your own monitor and use that instead of any other.</p>
<p><b>[Save]</b> You may want to save your file before proceeding. So head over to File&#062;Save and type the name <code>Fyug.sla</code> for your file. Save it in the FYug folder. You can also just click on the floppy icon in the taskbar, right underneath the menus, to save your file.</p>

<p><b>[Masthead Band]</b> The cover page of any magazine has its name emblazoned across the top. This is called the Masthead. Ours is titled, &#8220;FreedomYug.&#8221; We'll start by creating a semi-transparant band for the Masthead. Go to Edit&#062;Preferences&#062;General. Click on Display, and make sure this checked: &#8220;Use PDF1.4 Transparancy Features.&#8221; Click OK. Your document now supports transparant objects.</p>

<p>Click the fourth tool in the Tools palette. Should you hover your mouse over this, the roll-over text would display &#8220;Draw Various Shapes&#8221; or something similar. Select the rectangle shape from the drop-down menu. Click anywhere near the top-centre of the page and draw a rectangle. Make sure the rectangle is selected, and immediately go to the Properties palette, click on the 'X, Y, Z' tab, and enter the following values: X-Pos: 30mm. Y-Pos: 0mm. Width: 150mm. Height: 33mm. Give it a name, such as 'MastheadBand' in the Names field.</p>

<p>Then click on the 'Colors' tab in Properties. Click the Pencil tool to select the stroke or outline border. Click on 'None' in the colors list. Then, click the bucket icon to select the fill color. Click on 'Black' from the list of colors, and in the opacity field, enter 69%. You will see the band has turned semi-transparant, and partly shows the image through itself, in darkened colors. Experiment with Opacity and other colors to your taste.</p>

<p><b>[Add More Bands]</b> Draw another rectangle towards the centre of the image. In the Properties, give X-Pos: 93mm. Y-Pos: 160mm. Width: 115.35mm. Height: 13.75mm. Again in 'Colors', set the stroke to None, and the fill with Black at an opacity of 69%. Call this the 'HeadlineBand'. A third rectangle, named 'SubHeadBand' can be drawn slightly underneath this, at X-Pos: 100mm. y-Pos: 180mm. Width: 109.7mm. Height: 18.35mm. The fourth and final rectangle, this time a little square box, will have the following Properties: X-Pos: 20.5mm. Y-Pos: 245mm. Width and Height will both be 9mm.</p>
