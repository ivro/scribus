<p><b>[Done!]</b> Go to View menu and hide the guides, frames, margins, and grids. Your layout will look like the above screenshot. On page three, the sculpture picture frame has an invisible rectangle behind it, that wraps around the text. Just like we did with the drop-cap. The captions are just a text frame in the half-column. The generous white space at the bottom of the first column, is likewise just an invisible rectangle with 'flow text around frame' checked. Study the provided <code>FYug.sla</code> file for further details.</p>

<p><b>[Gradient-Filled Box Story]</b> The body text flows to page four. A single text frame in the half-column on the left contains the story and photo credits. The box-story at the bottom is a text frame that is formatted with various paragraph styles. The gradient in the text frame is applied in the 'Colors' tab of Properties. Underneath the 'bucket' icon a drop-down menu with the word 'Normal' reveals 'Vertical Gradient' among others. Choose LimeGreen at 40% as color#1, and CyanBlue at 20%. The text has a gap of 2.5mm from top, bottom, left, and right of the text frame. This is set in the 'Shape' tab of Properties. A red square is drawn to mark the story end.</p>

<h4>Design With Graphics and Freedom</h4>

<img src="scribusTutorial_html_m7d524861.jpg">
<p><b>[Many Unique Page Designs]</b> Page five jumps into graphics-oriented, creative freedom where page geometry is conformed to with defiance. Take a look at the screenshot here. It looks dramatic, but thanks to the power of Scribus, is quite easy to produce.</p>

<p><b>[Copy Elements to Template]</b> First, start by creating a new template in Edit&#062;Templates.... Choose a right page from the drop-down, call it '7steps'. A blank page graces your display. Then, click on your earlier FeatureR template, and drag the mouse from the top-left to the bottom-left of the page to select the red band on top with the text, and the page folio and page number text frame at the bottom. Click on your new '7steps' template. Right-click anywhere and select 'Paste.' Alternatively, go to Edit&#062;Paste from the menus. The elements are pasted into the exact position they belong to, thanks to the intelligence coded into Scribus. Change text to 'Newbies'.</p>

<p><b>[Visual Guidance]</b> Amazingly, the layout has 15 columns that align elements. Check the next screenshot. So, go to Page&#062;Manage Guides.... Add a Vertical guide at 36mm.</p>

<p>Then add 11mm to this to create another guide. Continue adding 11 mm to the result of the previous guide, until you read 179mm. Check 'Lock Guides' and click OK. Close the templates palette and add page five to your document, in the Pages palette, by dragging the '7steps' template to after page 4 in the page palette.</p>
