<p><b>[Seventh Wonder]</b> In a new text frame that you draw on the page, enter the letter '7' in Georgia Roman, at say, 200 points. Right-click the text frame, and from the popup menu, choose, 'Convert To &#062; Outlines'. The letter '7' is converted into a graphics outline. Align it to the top-left of your margin, and drag the lower-right to the second-last column, bottom-right. The graphic '7' automatically scales to fit the whole page.</p>

<p>Do you want to tweak the shape of '7'? Go to the Properties palette, to the 'Shape' tab, and click on 'Edit Shape.' Enjoy. Finally, padlock the '7'.</p>

<p><b>Important</b>: For <b>each</b> text frame or other element that is placed on this page, please uncheck 'Text flows around frame' so you dont' have text jumping to another position suddenly.</p>

<p><b>[Shapes for Text]</b> Drawing the shapes is easy. Click and hold on the square icon in Tools, and discover more than 16 shapes you can freely drag and draw in Scribus. Click on the 'Polygon' tool and you can even draw stars with as many corners as you wish and other options. For each shape, choose Fill 'None' and Stroke 'Black'. The thickness and style of the line is in the 'Line' tab of Properties, where I chose a 1 point thick solid line. Discover more styles and options for yourself here. The design looks good because all shapes are aligned to any two random vertical guides. In effect, that makes the width of each shape a multiple of 11mm, since the guides are all 11mm apart. 
</p>

<p>Right-click each shape, and choose 'Convert To &#062; Text Frame'. Then, enter the text using the story editor, or type it in directly, and apply a special '7steps body text' paragraph style, defined earlier.</p>

<p><b>[Use Scrapbook for Steps]</b> For the label 'Step 01' draw a box, fill it with a color, draw a text frame on top with the text 'Step 01', draw a red line to connect it to its relevant shape, and then group the whole label with its line, using Item&#062;Group in the menus.</p>

<p>Go to Tools&#062;Scrapbook menu. A dialog box displays, called the 'Scrapbook' meant for oft-used elements. Drag and drop the label into it. Also drag and drop the red-colored story-ender box. You can then drag and drop the label to any other shape, edit the text, re-draw or edit the red line to connect to it, and have lots of fun.</p>

<p><b>[Rotated Text]</b> In another fresh text frame, typeset 'Seven Steps To Software Samadhi' in all-caps, red letters. In the Properties palette, rotate it to 60 degrees in the 'X, Y, Z' tab. You could fine-tune the angle until it fits perfectly. Add all the other text on the page in their text frames, and you're done.</p>

<h4>Set Fire With SVG Graphics</h4>

<img src="scribusTutorial_html_51ce7895.jpg">
<p><b>[Graphics R Us]</b> The flame logo is a special type of graphic, called a 'Scalable Vector Graphic' or SVG for short. It can be enlarged to any size without loss of quality, and even the shape of the flame can be edited in Scribus. Yes, even the colors are imported from the image into the Colors palette of Scribus, and colors from within Scribus can be applied to the image, as has been done here to multiple copies of this graphic. Note how the text is set on a curve created within Scribus, and the automatic drop-caps to the text column.</p>

<p><b>[Ignite]</b>Start with a new Template, call it 'GyaanL'. Copy and paste the red band, text, and page folio and page number from another left-page template. Change the text to 'Education' in all-caps. In Page&#062;Manage Guides, add two vertical guides at 65mm and 70mm. Lock them, and close the templates palette. Add another page using this template, in the Page palette. Or you could use Page&#062;Insert... menu.</p>
