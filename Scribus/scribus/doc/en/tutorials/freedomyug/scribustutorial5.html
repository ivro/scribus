<p><b>[Track]</b> From the drop-down menu of Fonts in the Properties dialog box, choose 'Georgia Regular' or else Times Roman or any other font you fancy. Make the size: 84 points. Traditionally, a point is a unit of measure in the printing industry. 72.27 points make an inch. In digital print publishing, this is rounded-off to 72 points make an inch. Text size is usually measured in points. Select 'Red' from the drop-down menu next to the bucket icon, which stands for 'Fill Color' for our text. In the field labelled Kerning, enter -5 pts. Line Spacing at 72 pts. You will find the gaps between the text has squeezed, and the text has changed to the color red.</p>

<p><b>[Kern]</b>Stop reading the headline text. Look at it. You will find a larger gap between the 'm' and 'Y' of 'FreedomYug'. You will also find seemingly irregular gaps between other letters, such as between 'd' 'o' 'm', and 'Y' 'u', and even between 'u' and 'g'. This is because the shape of the Y curves in, creating an optical illusion of a bigger gap. The 'o' curves in from all sides, again creating the illusion of a bigger gap. Use the 'Edit Frame Content' icon, the one that looks like a hand next to a cursor. Click directly at the text, specifically between 'm' and 'Y'. In the Properties palette, enter '-11 pts' in the 'kerning' field. The gap shortens even more. Similarly, tighten the spaces between all the other letters individually, until the text 'FreedomYug' looks tightly kerned and tracked. Finally, drage the corner red sqaures of the text frame to the MastHeadBand, and click the padlock icon to lock its position.</p>

<p>Use the same technique, put the text 'The new era of computing' under 'FreedomYug' taking care to uncheck 'Text flows around frame'. Here, the text is actually set to loose tracking. I entered '+5pts' in the kerning field. For 'Why Khajuraho Needs Gnu/Linux' you need to press the return key after the word 'Khajuraho' in the Story Editor. Similarly, draw a text frame next to the green box, and enter the yellow-colored text. Use the image on Page 1 of this tutorial as a reference for all text elements.

<h4>Design Multiple Pages</h4>

<p><b>[Many Unique Page Designs]</b> This mag's pages are 210mm x 280 mm. However, not all pages will have the same look. I need three pages with a layout meant for a Features article, with perhaps two columns, and a generous white space on the outer left or outer right edge of the page. Another page could look like a feedback form, which could have only rows and tables. Still another page could be the Contents page.</p>

<p>Interestingly, once I decide that a Features page needs two columns, and a half-column of empty white space on the outer-left or outer-right, with a section name on the band on top, I want every page that runs a Feature story to look consistently the same. Thus, I need a 'Template Page' for Features, that defines all the columns and other common graphic elements for the Feature pages. I can then add as many pages as I wish into the actual Scribus file, from this template page, and add the actual text and photos to these pages.</p>

<p><b>[Make A Page Template]</b> Go to Edit&#062;Templates.... A dialog box listing existing templates opens up. You will only see one default template, called 'Normal.' That's the one you've been using for the cover page. Click on the button 'New'. In the resulting dialog-box, name the template 'FeatureL' and choose 'Left Page' from the drop-down menu. You end up with a blank page, with blue lines marking the outer margins.</p>
