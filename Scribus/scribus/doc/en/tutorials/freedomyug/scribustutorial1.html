<h4>What Can You Do With Scribus</h4>
<p>Two things. Use Scribus to design and produce magazines, newsletters, print-advertising, brochures, calendars, and pretty much anything that requires text to look visually appealing on paper. Scribus is also a great tool for authoring PDF documents with advanced features such as forms, buttons, passwords, and more. You can make your PDF documents even more 'intelligent' by using Javascript from within Scribus. Our tutorial focusses on how to use Scribus for professional-grade design of publications. It also shows a brief glimple of how to create an intelligent PDF. So let's get started.</p>
<p>For our project, we'll design seven pages for a magazine, including its cover page. Yet within these seven pages, you'll learn enough to create an entire 100-page magazine, or even a full-blown newspaper.</p>

<h4>Scribus And Its Sisters</h4>

<p><b>[Download Yesterday Night's Version]</b> Visit www.scribus.net and head to the downloads section. Please read the instructions in the documentation section on how to install Scribus for your platform (mac, win, linux, *bsd). You could start with the stable download available. As your
skills grow, may I strongly recommend you discard the stable version, and click on the 'changelogs' or 'CVS' button instead. This, because Scribus evolves rapidly on an almost nightly basis. The CVS version is equally stable, and quite often, more stable than the official stable version. It is also significantly ahead of the stable version in its features and capabilities. Every two or three days, I tend to issue the simple two-line commands from my PC, and get hold of a freshly-baked Scribus with a slew of new features added. Try it. You'll love it. Just follow the simple instructions on the Scribus site on how-to install from CVS. For those who don't know, CVS stands for Concurrent Versioning System, a clever way for several programmers from diverese geographical locations to store their software at a central repository as they dynamically work on it.</p>

<p>Do read the requirements page on the site. This because Scribus needs some rather important files installed on your system. For GnuLinux users, I specially recommend just installing the latest release of your favourite distribution. As an example, I spent nearly three weeks trying to install Scribus 1.1.6 under RedHat8. Each time I added a required file, another dependency would crop up. Finally, I just installed the latest Fedora in a separate partition, and Scribus installed within 20 minutes without a murmur.</p>

<p><b>[Get Acrobat Reader, even for GnuLinux]</b> Scribus is a great tool for creating PDFs. Yet not all PDF viewers are created equal. Especially under GnuLinux. So, head to adobe.com and download and install the latest, native version of Acrobat Reader for your platform, even for GnuLinux. Should you find a newer release of Acrobat Reader for Windows, say Version 6 for Windows, while you have Version 5 for GnuLinux, download the Version 6 for Windows, under GnuLinux. The developers of Scribus recommend you run this version using a Windows-emulator software under GnuLinux, such as WINE or CrossOver, to run this native Windows application under GnuLinux. However, this is not mandatory. You could still work with the older version, or view your files under Windows if dual-booting, or on another machine.</p>

<p><b>[Match Colors That Print]</b> Finally, if you wish to design publications, you need to ensure colors you see on screen match colors that print. For this, you need to install a special and separate piece of software, called a Color Management System, or CMS. Windows and Macintosh come with a CMS built-in, called ICM and ColorSync, respectively. Under GnuLinux, you need to install a free CMS, called LittleCMS. Download and follow the instructions at littlecms.com. You can also install versions of this under Windows and Macintosh. For this tutorial, LittleCMS is not necessary, though quite helpful.</p>
