<h2>Scribus on Windows - Read Me</h2>
<h4>What is different about Scribus ?</h4>
<p>First, Scribus was developed first and foremost on Linux and Unix machines, so sometimes the way things work are not always the 'windows way', but a more OS neutral way. Scribus also is natively ported to MacOSX and the behaviour changes are mostly in the way the menus work.</p>

<p>First, Scribus was developed first and foremost on Linux and Unix machines, so sometimes the way things work are not always the 'windows way', but a more OS neutral way. Scribus also is natively ported to MacOSX and the behaviour changes are mostly in the way the menus work. Second, a great deal of time and effort has been put into Scribus to generate very high quality commercial grade PDF. Provided you follow the recommended workflow in the documentation, you should have few issues with commercial printing.</p>

<h3>Hardware/Software Requirements:</h3>
<p>Windows 2000 SP4 or Windows XP - Windows 98 and ME have not been tested and are <strong>not supported</strong>. Any and all bug reports relating to Windows 9X will be closed quickly. </p>
<p>256 Mb or more system memory - the more the better. </p>
<p>Pentium III or better - 750MHz or better</p>
<p>XP Themes Disabled - Using "Classic Explorer Interface" is very strongly recommended.</p>

<h3>Before Downloading</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Install Ghostscript for Windows - <a href="http://ghostscript.com/doc/AFPL/index.htm">Ghostscript 8.53</a> or newer is recommended. This is important for EPS,PS import and printing. </li>
   <li>Scribus is very intolerant of poorly constructed or marginal grade fonts. Once installed, please read carefully the font setup section in the help documentation.  </li>
   <li>This is beta software which is undergoing many code changes daily. While it is fairly stable and usable, caution is advised. It is not recommended yet for production use. The underlying file format is undergoing rapid changes and will not be finished until the 1.3.3 or 1.3.4 version is released. </li>
 </ul>
 <h3>After Installing</h3>
 <ul>
<li>The first launch of Scribus or when a new user launches Scribus will be much longer than usual. This is because Scribus is creating a cache file of your fonts. Later re-starts will be much quicker.</li>
<li>Scribus is very particular about font quality. <strong>Use of freeware or shareware fonts is not recommended</strong>. There is an extensive and informative set of notes in the online help about fonts and commercial grade printing. Scribus scans fonts on launch and will disable obviously broken or problematic fonts. These notes are based on experience both with Scribus and commercial printing.</li>
 </ul>

<p>The Scribus Team is pleased to make available the only open source page layout application which runs natively on all 3 major desktop operating systems; Linux, MacOSX and Windows. Both online and direct commercial support is available for Scribus. There is a very friendly community which has developed around Scribus with the active participation of the developers.  Enjoy! </p>
