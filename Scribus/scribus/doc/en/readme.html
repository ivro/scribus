<h3>Scribus Version 1.2.4cvs Readme
</h3>
<h4>What's New ?</h4>
<p>Scribus now includes the Short Words plug-in, which was previously
installed as a separate plug-in. To prevent upgrade problems, you might want to
uninstall if it was installed via a package or RPM. This was also shipped as the
scribus-vlna package in both source and rpm format. See PACKAGING for more details.</p>

<p>Scribus also has a new OpenOffice.org Writer and Draw importer. This
requires libxml2, preferably version 2.6.x+. The OpenOffice.org Writer importer
will import styles from the OpenOffice.org doc and will create similar styles
within your Scribus document. Version 1.2.1 supported OpenOffice.org 1.1.x and Star Office 6/7 file formats.
Version 1.2.2+ supports OpenOffice.org 2.x/Star Office 8.x (OASIS) as well.
</p>

<p>Scribus 1.2.3 also includes 2 icc color profiles to make sure color management is working immediately after install. Note that these are basic generic profiles not sufficient to ensure good color management. See the help files for details under <a href="cms.html">color management</a>. Grey scale icc profiles in images are not supported in this release.</p>

<p>Scribus 1.2.3 also supports the proposed OpenIcc standard icc profile locations: $home/color/icc and /usr/share/color/icc/ under linux. Scribus will automatically detect them in these locations. Some distro neutral rpms for installing profiles are available on www.scribus.net.</p>

<p>For detailed changes please see the ChangeLog.</p>

<p>To use Scribus in your native language be sure that the environment variable
LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, LANG, Qt locale, OR the command line option of -l/--lang &lt;lang&gt; is set correctly.
</p>
	
<p>The EPS/PS import feature in 1.2.x uses advanced features of Ghostscript.We recommend ALL users update to the newest version of Ghostscript available	for your distro. There are detailed hints on docs.scribus.net for installing GS 8.5+ in parallel to the GS installed by your distro.</p>
	
 
	<p>
	If you have a 64-bit version of Qt, sometimes ./configure will not detect the
	64-bit version headers. Try : <pre>./configure --enable-libsuffix=64</pre> to test for 64-bit
	versions of libraries.</p>
	
	
	<p><strong>Other notes/known issues at the time of release:</strong></p>



<p>Registration color 100%C 100%M 100%Y 100%K does no work properly with UCR enabled.
A fix is expected in a future release. Registration with UCR disabled works properly. </p>
	
<p>There is a bug in font outline handling for some fonts in the freetype
	libraries. It's being worked on upstream. Don't file a bug report. Instead
	change the font used if you need the outlines. This is not a Scribus bug.
	Some testing has shown that this bug is not present in freetype 2.1.9+, but
	we counsel caution trying to upgrade freetype2. Upgrading freetype2 on some
	distros can be quite difficult.</p>
	
<p>	<strong>Issues with gradients:</strong></p>
	
<p>If you have gradient (e.g. with black color) with 50% shade in both beginning
	and end of gradient, you end up with darker center than edges. One expects the
	gradient to be with equal shade from beginning to end, especially if there is
	no other Color-Stops in-between them.
	
	This we believe is a libart issue and not fixable by us. The gradient will export
	and print properly.</p>
	
<strong>	For Debian Users:	</strong>
<p>
	If Scribus does not start while complaining about the absence of
	Postscript fonts please install either xfonts-scalable or gsfonts-x11.
	They are in the "Recommends" and will be installed by all sensible apt
	front-ends.
</p>	
<p><strong>	For SuSE 9.x Users:</strong></p>
	<ul>
<li>The littlecms libs 1.10, which shipped with Suse 9.0 does not offer complete
	support for all the the latest CMS features in Scribus 1.2. There are updated
	SuSE 9.x RPM's available on the Scribus.net site. We also recommend using the
	latest version of lcms.</li>
	
<li>If you are using Qt 3.3.x, please ensure you are using the latest Qt 3.3.2-2+
	rpms. The -2+ versions have an important fix for drag and drop in Scribus.</li>
	<li>
	To enable direct CUPS support which we recommend, make sure both cups-devel and
	openssl-devel are installed. Suse enables ssl support in CUPS.</li></ul>
	
	<p>Fedora/RH with Qt 3.3.2-6+ has the same fixes.</p>
	
<p>There is a separate file, PACKAGING for detailed hints and denotes on building
	packages for Scribus.</p>
	
<p>Many other hints and info are on the www.scribus.net and docs.scribus.net
	sites. Full compile, install and FAQ's are available there.</p>
	
<p>There is a lively on-line community, both on IRC @ #scribus on irc.freenode.net
	and the mailing list. Mailing list info can be found at:
