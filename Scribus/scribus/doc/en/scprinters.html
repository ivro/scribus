	<h2>Scribus Friendly Printers</h2>
	<p>Once you have your masterpiece created, sometimes the next step is getting is your file commercially printed.</p>
	<h4>What defines a "Scribus Friendly Printer" ?</h4>
	<p>First and foremost the ability to handle PDF directly without conversion to other formats. Conversion for placement into other page layout applications is <strong>not</strong> recommended and may result in reduced print quality. Ideally, a printer can handle a Scribus file natively, but is not a necessity. The most important is the ability to handle correctly newer versions of PDF without further alteration.</p>
