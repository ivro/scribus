<h2>GIMP 2.x</h2>

<p>There is not much to say about the best image application for Linux. GIMP 2.0 has too many improvements to list. A couple of notes though: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Some distributions do not install the "separate" plug-in which enables you to export CMYK TIFF and duotones.  This is very useful in certain circumstances. </li>
	<li>GIMP 2.0.x has a Display Filter Tool, which can do some "soft proofing" of images in CMYK colors, but it is not a completely finished feature. GIMP 2.2 will more than likely have much more complete color management features.</li>
	<li>Make sure you have the latest 2.0.x stable version. There were some important bug fixes made after 2.0.1.</li>
</ul>
