<title>Driving CUPS and Gimp-Print with Scribus</title>
<h2>Driving CUPS and Gimp-Print with Scribus</h2>
<p>CUPS, GIMP Print and Scribus make a great combination. With Scribus  you can &#034;drive&#034; CUPS directly from Scribus.</p>
<p>First, make sure you have the the correct CUPS development libraries installed before compiling Scribus. On Redhat, for example, they are named cups-devel.</p>
<p>The cups control panel in Scribus with the regular ijs plus ghostscript driver:</p>

<h3>Hints:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>CUPS has a separate gimp-print plug in which really improves the output of Scribus and any color docs GIMP-Print Drivers, especially those which have lots of pictures.</li>
<li><strong>cupstestppd</strong> is a command line utility which you can use to verify the correctness of PPD files. What is a PPD file ? A PPD file is a specially formatted text file which can be used on Linux,  MacOSX and Windows to install a true postscript printer. On Linux in combination with foomatic and CUPS it is used for <strong>all </strong>printers to enumerate all the printer's capabilities. This command line tool verifies that the ppd file meets the specs for ppd files. It there are issues, it will indicate how to remedy this. cupstestppd is most useful when using the manufactuerer's supplied PPD on Linux. </li>
	<li><strong>cups-calibrate</strong> is a command line program you can run as root to calibrate the printer. This only works with the gimp-print drivers - not other CUPS drivers. This is a step by step procedure which in some cases can improve the sharpness of your prints.</li>
	<li>CUPS also has an <strong>escputil</strong> command line utility for cleaning the heads or checking ink levels on Epson printers. If you have KDE installed, this can be accessed via the KDE Print Manager. Otherwise simply type: <strong>escputil -help</strong> for options.</li>
<li>To access setup and configuration for locally installed CUPS printers, there are 2 recommended methods to this with CUPS: 1. type <pre>http://localhost:631</pre> to use the CUPS web interface. 2. Use the KDE Print Manager. No other will give you full access to all the features with CUPS.</li>
</ul>
<p>The image below shows the difference with the GIMP-Print Plug-in installed.</p>

<p>The main difference is the more refined color and ink density adjustments available in GIMP Print. Often it will be slower than other drivers, but the output quality is the main reason. You can also use kprinter in combination with other programs which are not CUPS aware, but can benefit from high quality printing. As an example, Acrobat Reader on Linux before version 7.0.5 does not recognize CUPS, but has a command line window to call kprinter. Thus, you can with the correct settings, print high resolution PDF's with the same high quality as Scribus. </p>
<p>What I recommend with CUPS is to set up your everyday printer with the ijs or regular kprinter driver and then add a second printer instance with GIMP Print, so you have quicker output with everyday docs like text files etc..</p>
