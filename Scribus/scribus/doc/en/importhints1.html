<h2>Notes on Importing EPS into Scribus</h2>

<p>To better your chances of sucessfully importing EPS files it helps to have three ingredients: 1) An EPS file which is conformant to the published specs. Not all applications export EPS files with the same level of fidelity. 2 ) The latest Ghostscript available for your platform. 3) Where an EPS file has fonts embedded, ensuring Ghostscript's font paths are setup correctly.</p>
<p>There are two basic methods of importing EPS files and both have pluses and minuses. The first is simply importing the EPS file into an image frame, much like the methods used by the GIMP or Photoshop. That is <em>rasterize</em>, or turn the EPS file into a bitmap. The second and often preffered method is to import the EPS into Scribus as native objects. Both have trade-off, partly because of the inherent nature of EPS files. Like PDF, most if not all EPS are not meant to be edited, but importing them as native Scribus objects can allow some editing of some of the content. </p>
