<h2>Cross Platform Hints and Issues</h2>

<p>One thing that exposure has taught me is DTP is one of those areas where cross-platform issues come into play more than most types of applications. PDF does help, but sooner or later, something will pop-up. This section also includes hints on installing Scribus under Cygwin and particular hints for those who wish to use Scribus under fink and MacOSX.</p>
<p>Have a look through the <a href="http://ahnews.music.salford.ac.uk/scribus/modules.php?op=modload&name=Web_Links&file=index">Web Links</a> for cross-platform tools and downloads.</p>

<h2>Scribus and Cygwin</h2>
<p>Thanks to the KDE-Cygwin team, it is possible to run Scribus on Win2k or XP, via Cygwin. Moreover, the Scribus team has begun to intergrate some of the work needed to enable Scribus to compile straight from the normal tarball or cvs of Scribus.</p>
