<h2>Cross Platform Hints and Issues</h2>

<p>One thing that exposure has taught me is DTP is one of those areas where cross-platform issues come into play more than most types of applications. PDF does help, but sooner or later, something will pop-up. This section also includes hints on installing Scribus under Cygwin and particular hints for those who wish to use Scribus under fink and MacOSX.</p>
