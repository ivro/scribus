<h2>Cross Platform Hints and Issues</h2>
<p>One thing that exposure has taught me is DTP is one of those areas where cross-platform issues come into play more than most types of applications. PDF does help, but sooner or later, something will pop-up. </p>
<p>Have a look through the <a href="http://ahnews.music.salford.ac.uk/scribus/modules.php?op=modload&name=Web_Links&file=index">Web Links</a> for cross-platform tools and downloads. Of interest to PC users will be tools to open Mac archives aka Stuff-it files.</p>

<h2>Cross Platform Font Support</h2>
<p>Scribus has special support built in to support native Mac <strong>.dfont</strong> font format on Linux/Unix and Windows, but they must be available locally. To make them useable they need to be converted into a single binary file.
