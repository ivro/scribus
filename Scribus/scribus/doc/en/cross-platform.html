<h2>Cross Platform Hints and Issues</h2>
<p>One thing that exposure has taught me is DTP is one of those areas where cross-platform issues come into play more than most types of applications. PDF does help, but sooner or later, something will pop-up. </p>
<p>Have a look through the <a href="http://ahnews.music.salford.ac.uk/scribus/modules.php?op=modload&name=Web_Links&file=index">Web Links</a> for cross-platform tools and downloads.</p>

<h2>Scribus and Cygwin</h2>
<p>Thanks to the KDE-Cygwin team, it is possible to run Scribus on Win2k or XP, via Cygwin. Note that this is a much older version of Scribus and is now deprecated as a native port is under way.</p>
<p>The most up to date info can be found on the <a href="http://wiki.scribus.net/index.php/Installing_Scribus_on_Win32">Scribus Wiki</a>.</p>
