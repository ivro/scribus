<h2>Automatic Page Numbering</h2>

<p>Adding automatically incrementing page numbers is a two step process, but, once mastered, quite simple and reliable. There are two different methods which can be used independently or together. The first is to draw a text frame, click to get into edit mode and then go: <strong>Insert > Character > Insert Page Number</strong>. This will only add the page number to the currently selected page. The second uses Master Pages to enable automatic page numbering.</p>

<p>Scribus uses a special place holder within <a href="pagetemplate1.html">Master Pages</a> to indicate page numbers and allows them to be automatically included in your document without concern for moving, importing or deleting pages. </p>

<h4>Step One</h4>

<p>With your chosen document open, go <strong>Edit > Master Pages</strong>. If you have not created any other Master Pages, then there will be just one named "Normal." </p>
<h4>Step Two</h4>
<p>Next, create a text frame where you want the page numbers to go. Then, enter the edit mode by double clicking on the text frame and insert a page number as described above. In Scribus versions before 1.3.4, you need to create different master pages for one, two or three digit page numbers, whereas from 1.3.4 on, a single placeholder will suffice. Then save the Master Page by closing the Master Pages dialog and return to the main document.</p>

<table width="100%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="images/pagenumbering.png" title="Inserting Page Number placeholders." alt="Inserting Page Number placeholders"  /></td></tr></table>

<p>If you have more than one Master Page, you will need to add these placeholders to each Master Page that is expected to show a page number.</p>

<p>You can also apply styles and direct text formatting as you wish, just like a normal text frame. </p>
