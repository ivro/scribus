<h2>Automatic Page Numbering</h2>

<p>Adding automatically incrementing page numbers is a two step process, but once mastered, quite simple and reliable.</p>

<p>Scribus uses a special place holder within a <a href="pagetemplate1.html">page template</a> to indicate page numbers and allows them to be automatically included in your document without concern for moving, importing or deleting pages. </p>

<h4>Step One</h4>

<p>With your chosen document open, go <strong>Edit > Templates..</strong> If you have not created any other page templates, then there will be just one named Normal. </p>

<p>Next, create a text frame where you want the page numbers to go. Then, enter edit mode by double clicking on the text frame and place the pound or hash symbol as it is known.  &#035;  Use one, two or three symbols depending on the number of pages needed. For 1-9 pages use a single &#035;, for 11 - 99 pages use two &#035;  &#035;   Enter Alt+#. (US Keyboard users, are recommended to re-map this key to F7 for example.) Save the template and return to the main document.</p>

<table width="100%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="images/pagenumbering.png" title="Inserting Page Number placeholders." alt="Inserting Page Number placeholders"  /></td></tr></table>

<p>If you have more than one Page Template, you will need to add these placeholders to each template. You can apply styles, default font and fonrs sizes as you wish as well, just like a normal text frame. </p>
