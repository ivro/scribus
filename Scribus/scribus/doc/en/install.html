<p>Depending on the version of your distribution, there is the possiblity that you may need to upgrade various dependencies of Scribus and the above commands should make sure the required packages are installed.</p>
<p>For example, to access the font files you want to use in Scribus, Scribus relies on FreeType. For getting the best results we recommend using FreeType version 2.1.3 or later. Without having certain levels of software, we cannot guarantee correct operation of Scribus, or guarantee you achieve the  results you are trying to get. If the above commands do not upgrade all the dependencies on your system, please refer to the <a  href="install2.html">Requirements</a> page to make sure you have them.</p>
<p>For those who wish to install a more recent version of Scribus than that is included in their distribution, please check you have all the <a href="install2.html">Requirements</a> and continue into the <a href="install1.html">Scribus Source</a> section.</p>
