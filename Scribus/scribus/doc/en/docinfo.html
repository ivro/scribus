<h2>Scribus Document Information</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p align="justify">There are a couple of important points to consider in the doc info fields: 1) Scribus supports an initiative called the <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core Initiative</a>. Dublin Core, for short, is a set of specification on document meta-data.  2) The other feature is the fields on the first tab are used in PDF export, as well as also being part of Dublin Core meta-data. This data can be used by special indexing servers which can index PDF files, as well as Acrobat Reader. The second tab contains meta-data in Dublin Core form which can also be used for using a database to track Scribus files.</p>
<table width="100%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="images/docinfo.png" alt="PDF Doc Info" title="PDF Doc Info" /></td></tr></table>
<p>The second tab is document info which is strictly Dublin Core, thus defined by the specifications:</p>

<table width="100%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="images/docinfo2.png" alt="Dublin Core Properties" border="0" title="Dublin Core Properties in Document" /></td></tr></table>
