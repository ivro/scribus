<h2>Prepping files for Commercial Printing</h2>
<p>If you have never dealt with printers, nothing will assure a worry free experience for printing files commercially better than talking to your printer well in advance. Preventing mis-understandings and making them well aware in advance of your goals will more than likely prevent 90% of the mistakes. If you do not get satisfactory answers shop around. The printing business is competitive. The best  offer both technical savvy and good service. </p>


<h3>Ask questions:</h3>

<h4>If they accept PDF, which level ?</h4>

<p> PDF 1.3 (Acrobat 4), PDF 1.4 (Acrobat 5) or  PDF/X-3 (ISO Standard)  ? If they accept PDF/X-3, consider yourself lucky. This type of PDF is the most advanced for commercial printing. 
PDF/X is expressly designed to assure good color fidelity between systems. If they can recommend specific ICC profiles to use, then even better.</p>

<h4>Will they be converting the PDF to other formats like EPS? </h4>

<p>Be aware, not all page layout applications are capable of supporting some of the advanced PS3 or PDF 1.4 features Scribus supports. Unless the printer's systems are using PDF 1.4, this is <strong>not</strong> a recommended solution.</p>

<h4>Can they provide an ICC profile of their printer if color fidelity is critical?</h4>

<h4>What is the PS level of their RIP ?</h4>

<p>This can be a determining factor in how you prepare the files. If their RIP is  3015.xxx+, you can be sure their RIP can handle 100% of the features of Scribus. They might not be able to directly answer that, but... </p>

<p>Consult <a href="prepress.html">The Pre-Press Notes</a> and you can even take a printed copy of the PDF with you if the printer has not heard of Scribus. We have an online a listing of printers who support Scribus. See: <a href="scprinters.html">Scribus Printers</a></p>

<p>If there remains unanswered issues, ask on the mailing list or on IRC. Usually, there is someone knowledgable who can answer your questions.</p>
