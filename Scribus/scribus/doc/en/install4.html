<h2>Platforms</h2>
<p>Although developed primarily for Linux, the team is aware of ports or successful compilation for Scribus on FreeBSD, NetBSD, Fink (GPL applications running on OSX with XFree86), Solaris-Sparc and Solaris-x86, HP-UX11 and IRIX. In addition, the author has successfully complied and run earlier versions of Scribus under Solaris/Intel 8 using Sun's Openwin. Scribus has very little platform dependent code, except for Xlibs. News of other successful ports would be welcome. For running Scribus with KDE-Cygwin, see: <a href="cygwin.html">Windows with Cygwin</a>.</p>
