<h2>Creating PDF Presentations</h2>
<h3>Presentation PDFs</h3>
<p>Creating Presentation PDFs in Scribus, is not only easy, they work great. Using PDF in place of traditional "presentation" applications does have some advantages:</p>

<ol>
	<li>They are portable. You can create a presentation PDF with Scribus and display it on almost any computer with Acrobat Reader. Other types, usually require the application to be installed, and few are cross-platform.</li>
	<li>You can use all the drawing, text manipulation and image handling tools in Scribus, which are in many cases superior to those in other presentation applications. Few can import SVG or EPS files really well.</li>
	<li>You will have more precise typographic control of text.</li>
	<li>Because they are created in Scribus, you can export them with a higher resolution and they will print beautifully.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Recommended Settings and Hints:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Down-sample all images to 72-96dpi. Depending on the resolution of the displaying device, you might go as high as 120dpi, but higher will not gain you sharpness. But do this in an image editing program like the GIMP. Then import them into Scribus.</li>
	<li>Embed all fonts. This ensures the spacing and layout will remain the same no matter which platform you are using.</li> 
	<li>You can use US Letter or A4 in landscape mode for your layout. This will most closely match the screen output of Acrobat Reader in Full Screen mode.</li>
	<li>When displaying images like photos or screen shots, use a black or dark background on your page. They will make the colors more vibrant and give your viewers more contrast to see all the details in your slides.</li>
	<li>Use RGB colors for your images and always use Screen/Web for Export.</li>
	<li>One trick I have learned from using PDF for presentation. Load the PDF and run through each page once before giving the presentation, so the file is loaded in memory. This will make for smoother transitions on the screen.</li>
