<h2>PDF Exporting from Scribus</h2>
<h3>Scribus PDF Export Workflow</h3>

<p>Aside from interactive PDF creation explained later, for a given document, there are basically four paths to follow in creating your PDF:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Web download - Screen Reading - Interactive Forms</strong> - Follow this work flow when you want the smallest file size and high resolution printing is not required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Presentation Effects</strong> - the recommended settings are down-sample all images to 72, 96 or 120 dpi, depending on the resolution of the display screen. Embed all fonts and landscape page layouts will give you maximum image area on the screen if you plan on using a display projector. More hints on Presentation PDFs further on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Press Optimized</strong> - Clear all down-sampling or compression of images where image quality is of utmost importance. All images brought into to Scribus as placed images should be a minimum of 200 dpi and preferably 300 dpi or more for photos or TIFFs. Line art or vector graphics converted to an EPS in a program like Illustrator should have a minimum of 800 dpi for best results. Most vector EPS can be imported directly as native Scribus objects and recommended where possible. <strong>If your printer supports color managed PDF/X-3, This is the recommended method for optimal results. However, only the latest printing technology can support PDF/X-3. You should only enable this when your printer advises. </strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Print Optimized</strong> - This would mean targeting the PDF for printing on an office laser jet or ink jet. Recommended settings: down-sample all images to 300 dpi or less, embed fonts and keep your page margins with enough tolerance for margin limits on desktop and common office laser printers (approx. 6/10th of an inch or 1.5 cm.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
