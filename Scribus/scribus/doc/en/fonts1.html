<h2>Font Preferences and Managing Fonts with Scribus</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Scribus, has a couple of helpful and easy to use panels for managing fonts to use with Scribus, as well as, methods to make your own global font preferences and substitutions for Scribus easy. Withing the new font preferences, you can:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Set additional user defined font paths, which do not need root permissions, nor the need to manually adjust font paths in the Xfree86 config files.</li>
	<li>Set user preferences for font usage and font embedding within Scribus documents.</li>
	<li>Adjust settings for on the fly substitutions for missing or unavailable fonts.</li>
</ul>

<p>At first appearance, it might seem a bit confusing at first, as some options are grayed out initially. However, this does have some logic as we will see. One of the historical challenges in font handling with Xfree86 is when some applications start adding font paths to the default font path setup by Xfree86. The newer fontconfig mechanism and Freetype2 have greatly made brought sanity to one of the long standing end user problems with Linux on the desktop.</p>


<h3>Adding additional font paths:</h3>

<p>Open Scribus <strong>without</strong> any documents open. Then <strong>Edit &#062; Preferences &#062; Fonts</strong>, which will bring up a tabbed panel. Select the Additional Paths tab:</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="<?php echo $scr_shots_root; ?>fontpref1.png" alt="Adding additional font paths." title="Adding additional font paths."/></div>

<p>Here you can add font paths, which are not part of the XFree86 or X-org defaults. In the example here, we have added three user defined paths where there are fonts we wish to use within Scribus. The
directory <code>.fonts</code> is the default directory for use with the new <a href="<?php echo $site_content_root;?>fontconfig.php">fontconfig</a> mechanism with Xft2 included with newer distributions. After clicking <strong>OK</strong>, Scribus will add these font paths and any correctly installed fonts will be available immediately to new or existing documents you open.</p>

<h3>Font Substitutions</h3>

<p>When opening a Scribus document, Scribus runs a check to see if all fonts specified in a document are available. In the case a given font is not available on your workstation, you are given a choice upon opening the doc to make a substitution. You can can further adjust this preference with the <strong>Font Substitutions</strong> tab. This allows you to change the default substitution pattern. In this example, we are substituting Timmons Bold, included with Star Office 5.2, with a True Type version of Time New Roman.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="<?php echo $scr_shots_root; ?>fontpref2.png" alt="Font Substitutions" title="Font Substitutions" /></div>

<h4>Available Fonts</h4>

<p>This tab shows available system-wide fonts, including user specified paths. You can also change which fonts are used within Scribus on a font by font basis, as well as which fonts are embedded within postscript output.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="<?php echo $scr_shots_root; ?>fontpref3.png" alt="Available Fonts and Embedding Preferences" title="Available Fonts and Embedding Preferences"/></div>

<p>In this example, Nimbus Roman (a Times or Times Roman lookalike) has been disabled, as we find on occasion, it does not display optimally on other platforms, as Acrobat Reader will substitute its own Multi Master fonts.</p>

<h3>Other notes about font management:</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Sub-Setting</strong> fonts is including all the glyphs in the font in the postscript stream or a PDF. This allows smaller PDFs, at the expense of making it difficult to make minor edits in pre-press tools like Pit Stop. Unless you are sending PDF to commerical printer, you can sub-set fonts fairly reliably. This is important when you are trying to keep a downloadable PDF to the smallest size.</li>
	<li><strong>Open Type Fonts</strong> cannot be fully embedded by default. This greatly simplifies handling them in other applications. Open Type Fonts and Unicode True Type Fonts can be quite large.  Open Type Fonts are exported as outlines in PDF. The allows them to be used in PDF, where often other applications cannot use them.</li>
	<li><strong>Converting to outlines.</strong> Scribus can optionally convert text to postscript outlines. This can be a valuable option when your printer might not have a new enough RIP or imagesetter to accept PDF 1.4. This is also sometime a good option before exporting SVG or EPS files. When you are certain EPS files will be imported into other applications or across platforms this is recommended.</li>
