Warning:
Code stored here is highly experimental. It may be changed/removed
and/or moved elsewhere anytime. We can face some build problems
later if we will introduce more widgets.

Description:
Here can be built some plugins for Qt4 Designer.

It's disabled by default. You can enable it by -DWANT_DESIGNER=1
in the cmake run. Copy the *so files into Qt4 designer plugin
directory. Manually, of course.

Designer plugin dir on Suse: /usr/lib/qt4/plugins/designer/

The Scribus widgets are (suprisingly) in the "Scribus" group ;)
