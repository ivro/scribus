This folder is used to store ICC-compatible color profiles
for use with Scribus and LittleCMS.

You can get some sample profiles at: www.littlecms.com and
there are more links in the documentation under the DTP Links Page.

Another source for Profiles is a modern Windows installation,
in C:\Windows\System\Color on Win9x/NT4 or C:\Winnt\system32\spool\color
 on Win2k and XP are normally some ICC-Profiles. 

A hint for MacOS users: you can use your ColorSync-Profiles, which will be recognized by Scribus
if they have .icc or icm extensions.
