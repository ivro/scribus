Interlingua hyphenation

===================================
3. Install based on Latin dict:

As OpenOffice 1.0 does not have Latin as supported languages, you'll have to
add the "la" dictionary for a different language, for example Italian and set
this language for your Latin documents.

For example, to add to your Italian as Latin substitution just add to dictionary.lst:

DICT it IT it_IT
DICT it IT la
or
HYPH it IT hyph_it_IT
HYPH it IT ia

This will allow both to be considered Italian.  Could be set to English or whatever.

Forthcoming OpenOffice versions might also support Latin as language.
