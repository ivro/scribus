Experimental support for the use of Boost::Python has been added to the Python
interface. All Boost code is exported in a separate module, scribus2, that is
only created if Boost::Python is available.

Currently there's no autotools support for this in Scribus, so to compile the
scripter with this highly experimental feature you must:

$ make clean
$ make CXXFLAGS=" -DHAVE_BOOST_PYTHON -fexceptions " LDFLAGS=" -lboost_python "
$ make install

For more information on Boost::Python see:
	http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/
	http://www-eleves-isia.cma.fr/documentation/BoostDoc/boost_1_29_0/libs/python/doc/tutorial/

It's strongly recommended that you read the FAQ at:
	http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/v2/faq.html
(probably once before reading the code, and again after).
