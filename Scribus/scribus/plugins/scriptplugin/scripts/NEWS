New since v0.6.1   
    Added a font sample preview panel. This will only be displayed if certain system
    requirements are met. Otherwise the panel will be hidden.    
    Changed version numbers to accomodate parallel releases using other widget sets.
    Tkinter versions will now have the letters "tk" appended after the version number, a
    qt version would be "qt". Note that a qt version will not be appearing until issues will PyQt
    can be resolved.

New since V0.5a
    Optional Page Numbers.
    Optional Table of Contents creation.
    Added an optional binding offset. Leaves extra space for the binding edge.
    Added Double sided paper facility. Inserts a blank page after table of contents
    if required, to force the main sample pages to always start on an odd page
    number. This also flips the binding offset to the other side when printing the
    even numbered side.
    Better layouts.
    Has more built in default font options for headers, table of contents and
    sample labels.
    Users can now select more than one font at a time in the list boxes.
