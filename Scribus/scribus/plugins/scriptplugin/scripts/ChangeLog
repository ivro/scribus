20061016 v 0.8.2tk
    A one liner change by Jean Ghali to line #734 to add the extra parameter missing.
20051124 v0.8tk final:
    Cleaned up the checkbox labels and layout.

20051121 v0.8tk preview 3:
    Calls the new Scribus zoomDocument() function to make the completed font
    sample document fit in Scribus window.
    
    Grey out "Start page number count from first page" when "Print TOC" is
    not checked as without a table of contents the first page would always 
    start on the same page number making this option irrelevant.

20051120 v0.8tk preview 2:
    Replaced the newDoc() with newDocument(). Have not put any fallback code
    for use with earlier Scribus versions.
    
    When using double sided option we now make use of Scribus ability to display
    pages side by side as default. You may need to zoom out to view the
    complete document width. This is because currently there is no way of setting
    "Fit To Page" from the Scripter.

20050902 v0.8tk preview 1:
    Rearanged the initialisation. If no fonts are found for the Table of
    Contents, page numbers and font sample labels, the script shows a
    message box listing the problem and a possible solution as well as a message
    to the console.
    
    A Scribus messagebox alerts the user if Tkinter is not found. Previously
    this message was only printed to the console.
    
    Now able to do a dummy run to calculate and report the amount of samples
    that will fit on a page. This enables the script to correctly calculate
    how many sheets will be required. Previously it was always assumed that
    there would be 3 sample blocks on a sheet. This is now not always the case.
    
    Added menu. Also added "about" and "settings" dialogs.
    
    Sample rows can be selected or unselected to save on paper. The settings are
    automatically saved when changed and can be set as user defaults.
    
    User can choose to have page numbers count from first page of the toc instead
    of the first page of samples. This can be helpful if wanting to quickly look
    up a font in the toc and then using the Scribus page navigator dialog to go to
    the actual page on the screen to view it without printing it out.
    
    Added initial support for a sample paragraph. The sample paragraph defaults
    to "off" due to the amount of space it uses on the page.
    
    Some widgets read their defaults from a config dictionary.
    
    Many code cleanups. Classes used for settings storage have been replaced with
    dictionaries to make it easier for users to customise.
