# Prevent the KDE build system from piling stuff we don't want into the
# toplevel dir of the "make dist" tarballs.

# We have to list everything we want to go into the root level of the tarball
# in EXTRA_DIST, except dirs listed in SUBDIRS.
#
# We have to include configure.in and friends because the auto-generated make
# rules to re-generate configure if its .in files are modified cause the build
# to fail if those files are absent.
#
# We also have to list anything we want included from the admin dir that the
# build magic doesn't know to include in dist tarballs automatically. In this
# case, we include enough to handle the auto-regeneration of configure after
# configure.in, aclocal.m4, or acinclude.m4 are changed, since that's done
# using rules defined here and not in the admin magic.
# DO NOT INCLUDE THE "admin" DIR, ONLY FILES WITHIN IT. Otherwise you'll get
# *everything* in admin, including the CVS dirs etc.
