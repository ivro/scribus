This module is being used to track repository admin info such as appropriate permission and group settings and the reasons for them.

Groups:
    {{{ cvs} cvscomm } cvsadm }
    cvs: read and check out
    cvscomm: commit, branch, tag
    cvsadm: new modules

Permissions:
    /cvs                    root:scvs       2750
        Everybody with cvs access needs to be able to read this, but nobody
        else should be able to even traverse into it. This provides our
        limit on read/checkout access.
    /cvs/CVSROOT            root:scvsadm    2775
        Only admins should be able to write to the CVSROOT, everybody
        needs to read and explore it.
    /cvs/CVSROOT/*          root:scvsadm    664
        Only admins need to be able to alter most of these files.
    /cvs/CVSROOT/history    root:scvs       664
        To check out a module you must be able to write to this file
    /cvs/Scribus            root:cvscomm    2775
        Everybody needs to read this, but only committers need to write
        to it.
    /cvs/Scribus/CVSROOT    root:cvscomm    ????
        NFI
