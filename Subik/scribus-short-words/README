MISC NOTES

* Specify the right directory in ./configure --prefix=
* IMPORTANT:
  You can use your own short words configuration which can be specified
  in ~/.scribus/scribus-short-words.rc
  Please note that it will replace the previous configuration so to
  append additional words you'll have to copy it from
  $prefix/lib/scribus/plugins/scribus-short-words.rc first!
* See the documentation distributed with this plugin in:
  {prefix}/share/scribus/doc/scribus-short-words

 'Scribus-swort-words.pro' for easy translations added (lupdate *pro).
 Updated Czech and Polish translations.
 It could be configured in ~/.scribus/scribus-short-words.rc
 The "physics and math" stuff seems handled well. (e.g. 12~kg).

27.06.2004 Rewritten. Totally :)
 Prepared configuration for the other languages (Polish now).
 It can use whole words - not only one character.
 Uses less memory.
 Quicker text handling (that's just my oppinion exactly :)).
 In all words it depends more on the Qt than on my strange algorithms.
