Two
simple
things
to
consider
are
alternating
bass
lines
and
walking
bass
lines
There
are
lots
of
things
one
does
when
walking
the
bass
that
are
used
over
and
again
since
the
earliest
days
of
blues
and
jazz
and
rock
and
bluegrass
and
more
Alternating
bass
lines
are
like
you
hear
in
simple
country
songs
like
Good
Hearted
Woman
by
Willie
Nelson
Playing
the
root
D
and
alternating
one
two
one
two
with
a
fifth
A
played
below
the
root
From
that
there
are
ways
to
use
the
alternating
root
V
for
different
styles
of
music
Likewise
a
walking
bassline
for
example
Root
third
above
root
fifth
above
that
and
back
to
the
third
one
two
three
four
can
vary
from
that
simplest
walk
by
playing
it
Root
pause
third
fith
Root
pause
third
fifth
even
if
you
don
t
put
any
feeling
in
it
it
moves
differently
If
someone
trys
to
tell
you
they
don
t
have
an
aresenal
built
up
of
many
simple
variations
on
the
above
and
more
he
s
being
disingenuous
You
can
t
help
it
they
just
show
up
and
they
are
handy
and
beautiful
You
have
lines
riffs
licks
and
you
have
a
bunch
of
cliches
if
you
want
to
reduce
them
to
that
but
they
are
also
staples
groove
foundations
that
have
to
be
understood
and
executed
both
before
progressing
and
after
Likewise
a
person
tends
to
develop
habits
around
use
of
technique
as
well
Bends
hammers
Pulls
zoooooms
pops
I
confess
to
a
horribly
inappropriate
use
of
thumb
on
occaision
Chromatic
runs
syncopation
melody
counterpoint
fucking
around
let
s
not
forget
that
Twang
